## üîç Project Overview

The dashboard provides an at-a-glance summary of:

- Total Sales by Region  
- Profit Margins by Product Category  
- Monthly Shipping Cost Analysis  
- Order Priority Breakdown

These views were built to support data-driven decisions in sales strategy, logistics, and customer priority handling.

## üìà Large Events and Trends Identified

- **High Shipping Costs in February:** Same-Day shipping peaked significantly in February, suggesting either seasonal demand or fulfillment inefficiencies.
- **Regional Performance Gaps:** Canada and Central African regions lag far behind Western US and Oceania, indicating areas for market growth or performance optimization.
- **Technology Outperformance:** Technology products delivered consistently high profit margins, making them a priority for expansion and marketing.
- **Order Prioritization:** The majority of orders fall into the 'Medium' and 'High' priority categories, showing a balanced order pipeline with potential gains from upselling to 'Critical' orders.
