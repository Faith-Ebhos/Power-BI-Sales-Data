📊 Superstore Sales Dashboard Project
Welcome to my Superstore Sales Dashboard project! This project showcases my ability to turn raw sales data into compelling, interactive insights using Power BI and Excel.


🔍 Project Overview
This dashboard analyzes and visualizes sales data from a superstore dataset, with a focus on:

Total Sales by Region

Profit Margins by Product Category

Shipping Cost Trends by Month

Order Priority Breakdown

These visuals help decision-makers identify top-performing regions, cost inefficiencies, and opportunities for growth.

🚀 Tools & Skills Demonstrated
🧠 Data Analytics
Power BI

Designed interactive visuals and slicers (Year, Region, Category, Ship Mode)

Created custom tooltips and conditional formatting

Used DAX for calculated fields (e.g., % of Total Orders)

Combined multiple views (bar, scatter, pie, line) into one cohesive dashboard

Microsoft Excel

Data cleaning and transformation (handling missing values, normalization)

Pivot tables and charts

Sorting, filtering, and conditional formatting for quick analysis

📊 Data Visualization
Used bar charts, scatter plots, line graphs, and pie charts for clarity and storytelling

Emphasized data-driven design, ensuring each chart provides value

Highlighted insights (e.g., Canada’s sales with color-coded bar)

🔧 Data Preparation
Aggregated and grouped data for regional, monthly, and categorical analysis

Identified outliers and trends in shipping costs and profit margins

📈 Key Insights
Canada had one of the lowest sales among all regions.

Shipping Costs had major spikes, especially in February for Same-Day delivery.

Technology category showed high profits per sale compared to others.

High priority orders made up nearly 30% of total orders.

📂 Files Included
Sales Dataset.xlsx – Raw dataset used for dashboard creation

💡 Future Improvements
Automate monthly data updates using Power BI's data refresh feature

Add predictive modeling using Python or R for sales forecasting

Integrate data from multiple years and sources (e.g., inventory or customer satisfaction)
